## Introduction
Phone number generator is a Javascript application that generates random phone numbers for a company. It allows a user
to specify the number of phone numbers (s)he wants to generate. The application then generates the random phone numbers based on the total number of phone numbers specified by the user. The result is then saved in a text file which can be downloaded by the user.
